## 8. Lessons carried in (dev-cadence + tdgrind)

- **One anchor per checkout** — enforced at creation, not warned about later.
- **Ledger before idle** — the stranded-work flag makes the audit continuous.
- **One writer per shared resource** — only the host agent touches tmux.
- **State from the tool, not from the screen** — scraped state is labelled, never silent.
- **A record that exists only in scrollback is not a record** — pipe-pane from the first byte.
- **A reboot must not need a human** — systemd + linger, not a cron that notices.
- **Verify a real completion, not a catalog** — `credentials_ok()` and `usage()` are live
  calls, and the UI shows when they last succeeded.
