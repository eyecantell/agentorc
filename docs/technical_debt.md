# Technical Debt

Known issues, compromises, and deferred work. Add an entry any time a problem is identified but not immediately fixed — no exceptions, however small (see [`cadence.md`](cadence.md) §2).

**This file holds open work only.** The summary table below lists exactly the entries that have a body in this file — one row each, no history. When an entry is fully resolved, move the whole body to [`technical_debt_archive.md`](technical_debt_archive.md), delete its summary row, and replace **Fix** with the resolution date plus a pointer to whichever doc/code now carries the lasting content. An entry that is only *partly* resolved stays here, with what shipped and what remains spelled out in its **Status**.

IDs are `TD-` plus a zero-padded three-digit number, assigned in order and never reused. Priority is a field, never part of the ID.

## TD-001: Short title of the problem

**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
**Added:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Open
**Location:** `path/to/file.py` (function/section)

**Why:** what's wrong, how it was found, and the reasoning — future sessions need the why, not just the symptom.

**Fix:** concrete direction(s), and what would count as done.

**Related:** other TDs, PRs, decision docs.
