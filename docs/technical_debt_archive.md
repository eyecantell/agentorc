# Technical Debt Archive

Resolved entries moved from [technical_debt.md](technical_debt.md), appended in resolution order (the archive doubles as a chronological account of what has been paid down). Each keeps its original TD number forever (numbers are never reused), keeps its original **Why**, and replaces **Fix** with `**Resolved:** YYYY-MM-DD (PR #n)` plus a pointer to wherever the lasting content now lives.

## TD-011: VS Code link path is not URL-escaped (spaces break the URI)

**Priority:** Low
**Added:** 2026-09-06
**Status:** Resolved
**Location:** `src/agentorc/ui/app.py` (`vscode_url`)

**Why:** The session directory is interpolated raw into `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+<host><path>?windowId=_blank`. A directory with a space or `?` produces a malformed URI and the link silently does nothing. Pre-existing; noted by the PR #10 review.

**Resolved:** 2026-09-10 (PR #35) — `vscode_url` percent-encodes the path (`urllib.parse.quote(directory, safe="/")`) in both URI forms; `tests/test_ui.py::test_vscode_url_opens_a_new_window` covers a space and a `?`.

## TD-020: `_removed_at` compares wall-clock stamps; a clock step re-adopts a just-removed pane

**Priority:** Low
**Added:** 2026-09-10 (review note on PR #22, 2026-09-07; ledgered late)
**Status:** Resolved
**Location:** `src/sessionorc/agent.py` (`_reconcile`, `rpc_remove`)

**Why:** `rpc_remove` stamps `_removed_at[id] = datetime.now(UTC)` and `_reconcile` skips
re-adopting a pane whose stamp is newer than the tick's `snapshot_at`, forgetting stamps after a
minute. All three are wall-clock; an NTP step or a suspend/resume between them can make a stamp
look older than the snapshot (the dead pane comes back as a nameless shell for a tick) or keep
it alive past the minute. Harmless in practice, which is why it is Low, but the guard exists
because the same re-adoption bit us on first use (2026-09-06).

**Resolved:** 2026-09-10 (PR #36) — the guard no longer compares clocks at all: `HostAgent._removed` maps a name to the removed pane's tmux `created` epoch plus a `time.monotonic()` stamp used only for expiry (`REMOVED_GUARD_SECONDS`); `_is_removed_pane` decides by pane identity. `snapshot_at` stays a `datetime` because its only remaining comparison (`CREATE_GRACE`) is against the persisted `created` field. Test: `tests/test_agent_paths.py::test_pane_snapshot_older_than_a_remove_does_not_readopt` (includes a one-hour wall-clock step).

## TD-021: Immediate id reuse after `remove` can mis-adopt the new pane for one tick

**Priority:** Low
**Added:** 2026-09-10 (review note on PR #22, 2026-09-07; ledgered late)
**Status:** Resolved
**Location:** `src/sessionorc/agent.py` (`_reconcile` adoption loop), `src/sessionorc/naming.py`

**Why:** The adoption guard is keyed by tmux session *name*. If a session is removed and a new
one with the same name is created by hand before the next tick, the new pane is skipped for
that tick (the stamp says "just removed") and then adopted as a nameless shell on the one after;
if the new one is created through the agent, the record exists and the guard never applies.
One tick of wrong state, only for hand-created reuse of a just-removed name.

**Resolved:** 2026-09-10 (PR #36) — `_is_removed_pane(name, pane)` skips a pane only when `pane.created <= ` the removed pane's creation time, so a hand-made session reusing the name is adopted on the first tick that sees it. Residual: `created` is whole seconds, so a pane that was created, exited, observed, removed and had its name reused all inside one second (or whose pane was already gone at remove, `created` None) stays skipped until the guard expires (`REMOVED_GUARD_SECONDS`, 60 s). Covered by the same test as TD-020, including the equal-second case.

**Related:** PR #22 review; TD-020; TD-010 (adoption of hand-started sessions).
