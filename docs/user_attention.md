# User Attention Board

Items that need the user to act or decide, plus in-flight work parked by a session. Sessions add entries **the moment they arise** and remove them when handled. Keep this file small — durable debt belongs in [technical_debt.md](technical_debt.md); this board is only "a human must act or decide."

All conventions — entry format and the `<host>` semantics, `Due:` dates and snoozing, the `Swept:`/`Swept-deep:` sweep stamps — live in [docs/cadence.md §3](cadence.md#3-never-strand-work). That file is SYNC (improvements reach every consumer on re-sync); this skeleton is SEED (yours, never overwritten), which is why the explanations do not live here (dev-cadence TD-17).

Format: `- [ ] YYYY-MM-DD (session <first-8-of-session-uuid> on <host>, or n/a) — what's needed. Context: TD-NNN / PR #N / branch. Due: YYYY-MM-DD.`

## Needs the user
